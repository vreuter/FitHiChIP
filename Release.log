FitHiChIP Release Logs
----------------------

Release 1.0 - 18th October 2017
===============================

FitHiChIP supports processing BAM and PAIRIX formatted alignments of PLAC seq and HiChIP data.
The first release contains functions for following:
1) Processing input alignment files, 
2) finding statistical significant interactions among binned segments (employing FitHiC)
3) Modeling four different types of interactions - peak to peak, peak to non peak, peak to all, and all to all
4) Manual / README 

Release 2.0 
============

A major upgraded release, with the following modifications:

1) In addition of supporting BAM and PAIRIX formatted alignment, current release supports processing the valid pairs (txt or txt.gz) file 
generated by HiC-Pro pipeline.
2) Every input file and related parameters are now to be provided by a configuration file. Sample configuration file and sample 
script for executing FitHiChIP through configuration file is also included.
3) FitHiC module is now incorporated with bias correction (normalization) technique. User can opt for employing raw FitHiC or bias corrected 
FitHiC (along with specifying bias correction related parameters) through the configuration file settings.
4) Interaction detection between individual binned segments through multi-threaded execution is modified.
5) Significant interactions originated and terminated in neighboring bins can be merged together to form one single interaction. This parameter is 
optional, however, and can be specified through the configuration file.
6) The code requires a peak detection output file (mandatory parameter) even for determining the ALL to ALL (every pairs of bins) 
interactions. Information of peak segments is required for bias correction.
7) Computation of coverage for individual bins is now upgraded and placed in a single (and separate) source file, supporting 
input alignments of BAM, PAIRIX or HiC-Pro generated Validpairs file.
8) Contacts (among bins) are initially detected without any distance threshold. Later, distance threshold specific filtering is employed. 
This technique is useful for quick comparison of interactions among different distance thresholds.
9) The preprocessing scripts are upgraded. Separate preprocessing scripts for PLAC-seq and HiChIP data are provided.
